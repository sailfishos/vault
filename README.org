** Backup API

Each application should register path to executable to be invoked for
backup/restore. The API itself is just a set of command line options.

Options:

- --dir -- points to destination directory to save application
  structured data;

- --bin-dir -- destination directory for blobs;

- --home-dir -- user home directory path;

- --action -- which action should be executed. Possible values are:
  import, export, clear.
